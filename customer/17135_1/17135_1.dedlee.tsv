		<p><span class="dropcapa">&nbsp;</span><span class="dropcap">A</span> mid the many celebrations last Christmas Eve, in various places by different persons, there was one, in New York City, not like any other anywhere. A company of men, women, and children went together just after the evening service in their church, and, standing around the tomb of the author of "A Visit from St. Nicholas," recited together the words of the poem which we all know so well and love so dearly.</p>
	
	p.3_2
		<p>Dr. Clement C. Moore, who wrote the poem, never expected that he would be remembered by it. If he expected to be famous at all as a writer, he thought it would be because of the Hebrew Dictionary that he wrote.</p>
	p.3_3
		<p>He was born in a house near Chelsea Square, New York City, in 1781; and he lived there all his life. It was a great big house, with fireplaces in it;&mdash;just the house to be living in on Christmas Eve.</p>
	p.3_4
		<p>Dr. Moore had children. He liked writing poetry for them even more than he liked writing a Hebrew Dictionary. He wrote a whole book of poems for them.</p>
	
page_s.4
	p.4_1
		<p>It was printed in a newspaper. Then a magazine printed it, and after a time it was printed in the school readers. Later it was printed by itself, with pictures. Then it was translated into German, French, and many other languages. It was even made into "Braille"; which is the raised printing that blind children read with their fingers. But never has it been given to us in so attractive a form as in this book. It has happened that almost all the children in the world know this poem. How few of them know any Hebrew!</p>
	p.4_2
		<p>Every Christmas Eve the young men studying to be ministers at the General Theological Seminary, New York City, put a holly wreath around Dr. Moore's picture, which is on the wall of their dining-room. Why? Because he gave the ground on which the General Theological Seminary stands? Because he wrote a Hebrew Dictionary? No. They do it because he was the author of "A Visit from St. Nicholas."</p>
	p.4_3
		<p>Most of the children probably know the words of the poem. They are old. But the pictures that Miss Jessie Willcox Smith has painted for this edition of it are new. All the children, probably, have seen other pictures painted by Miss Smith, showing children at other seasons of the year. How much they will enjoy looking at these pictures, showing children on that night that all children like best,&mdash;Christmas Eve!</p>

*Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
*assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
*goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
*remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
*Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
*and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
*To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
*and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

*Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
*Literary Archive Foundation
*
*Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
*spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
*increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
*freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
*array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
*($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
*status with the IRS.
*
*The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
*charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
*States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
*considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
*with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
*where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
*SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
*particular state visit http://pglaf.org
*
*While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
*have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
*against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
*approach us with offers to donate.
*
*International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
*any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
*outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
*
*Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
*methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
*ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
*donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
*
*
*Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
*works.
*
*Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
*concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
*with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
*Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
*
*Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
*editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
*unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
*keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
*
*Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
*
*     http://www.gutenberg.net
*
*This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
*including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
*Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
*subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
