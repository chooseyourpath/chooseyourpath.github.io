    Jack found one fine morning<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I have been told,</span><br />
    His goose had laid him<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">An egg of pure gold.</span><br />
    <br />
    Jack rode to his mother,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The news for to tell,</span><br />
    She called him a good boy<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said it was well.</span><br />
    <br />
    Jack sold his gold egg<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a rogue of a Jew,</span><br />
    Who cheated him out of<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The half of his due.</span><br />
    <br />
    Then Jack went a-courting<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A lady so gay,</span><br />
    As fair as the lily,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sweet as the May.</span><br />
    <br />
    The Jew and the Squire<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came behind his back,</span><br />
    And began to belabour<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sides of poor Jack.</span><br />
    <br />
    And then the gold egg<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was thrown into the sea,</span><br />

    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which he vowed he would kill,</span><br />

    <br />
    The moon was shining sulkily,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because she thought the sun</span><br />

    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">After the day was done&mdash;</span><br />
    "It's very rude of him," she said,<br />

    <br />
    The sea was wet as wet could be,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sands were dry as dry.</span><br />
    You could not see a cloud, because<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">No cloud was in the sky:</span><br />
    No birds were flying overhead&mdash;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">There were no birds to fly.</span><br />
    <br />
    The Walrus and the Carpenter<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were walking close at hand;</span><br />
    They wept like anything to see<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such quantities of sand:</span><br />
    "If this were only cleared away,"<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They said, "it <i>would</i> be grand!"</span><br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><br />
    "If seven maids with seven mops<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swept it for half a year,</span><br />
    Do you suppose," the Walrus said,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That they could get it clear?"</span><br />
    "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shed a bitter tear.</span><br />

    "O Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Walrus did beseech.</span><br />
    "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the briny beach:</span><br />
    We cannot do with more than four,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give a hand to each."</span><br />
    <br />
    The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never a word he said:</span><br />
    The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shook his heavy head&mdash;</span><br />
    Meaning to say he did not choose<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To leave the oyster-bed.</span><br />
    <br />
    But four young Oysters hurried up,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">All eager for the treat:</span><br />
    Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their shoes were clean and neat&mdash;</span><br />
    And this was odd, because, you know,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They hadn't any feet.</span><br />
    <br />
    Four other Oysters followed them,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet another four;</span><br />
    And thick and fast they came at last,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And more, and more, and more&mdash;</span><br />
    All hopping through the frothy waves,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scrambling to the shore.</span><br />
    <br />
    The Walrus and the Carpenter<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walked on a mile or so,</span><br />
    And then they rested on a rock<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conveniently low:</span><br />
    And all the little Oysters stood<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waited in a row.</span><br />
    <br />
    "The time has come," the Walrus said,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To talk of many things:</span><br />
    Of shoes&mdash;and ships&mdash;and sealing-wax&mdash;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cabbages&mdash;and kings&mdash;</span><br />
    And why the sea is boiling hot&mdash;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whether pigs have wings."</span><br />
    <br />
    "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Before we have our chat;</span><br />
    For some of us are out of breath,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all of us are fat!"</span><br />
    "No hurry!" said the Carpenter.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They thanked him much for that.</span><br />

    "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Is what we chiefly need:</span><br />
    Pepper and vinegar besides<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are very good indeed&mdash;</span><br />
    Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">We can begin to feed."</span><br />
    <br />
    "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turning a little blue.</span><br />
    "After such kindness, that would be<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dismal thing to do!"</span><br />
    "The night is fine," the Walrus said.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Do you admire the view?</span><br />
    <br />
    "It was so kind of you to come!<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you are very nice!"</span><br />
    The Carpenter said nothing but<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cut us another slice:</span><br />
    I wish you were not quite so deaf&mdash;<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've had to ask you twice!"</span><br />
    <br />
    "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To play them such a trick,</span><br />
    After we've brought them out so far,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made them trot so quick!"</span><br />
    The Carpenter said nothing but<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The butter's spread too thick!"</span><br />

    "I weep for you," the Walrus said:<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I deeply sympathize."</span><br />
    With sobs and tears he sorted out<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those of the largest size,</span><br />
    Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before his streaming eyes.</span><br />
    <br />
    "O Oysters," said the Carpenter,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You've had a pleasant run!</span><br />
    Shall we be trotting home again?"<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But answer there came none&mdash;</span><br />
    And this was scarcely odd, because<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'd eaten every one.</span><br />

    But Robin cheered her up;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My pretty Jen," said he,</span><br />

    Now happy be the bridegroom,<br />

    "And you will have him, Jenny,<br />

    <br />
    Then on her finger fair<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cock Robin put the ring;</span><br />
    "You're married now," says Parson Rook,<br />

    <br />
    "Happy be the bridegroom,<br />

    <span class="smcap">The</span> Brown Owl sits in the ivy-bush,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she looketh wondrous wise,</span><br />
    With a horny beak beneath her cowl,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a pair of large round eyes.</span><br />
    <br />
    She sat all day on the selfsame spray,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">From sunrise till sunset;</span><br />
    And the dim grey light, it was all too bright<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the Owl to see in yet.</span><br />

    <div class='title'>DAME DUCK'S LESSONS TO HER
    DUCKLINGS.</div>


    <div class="poem1">
    <span class="smcap">Old Mother Duck</span> has hatched a brood<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of ducklings, small and callow:</span><br />
    Their little wings are short, their down<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is mottled grey and yellow.</span><br />
    <br />
    There is a quiet little stream,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That runs into the moat,</span><br />
    Where tall green sedges spread their leaves,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And water-lilies float.</span><br />
    <br />
    Close by the margin of the brook<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old Duck made her nest,</span><br />
    Of straw, and leaves, and withered grass,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And down from her own breast.</span><br />
    <br />
    And there she sat for four long weeks,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In rainy days and fine,</span><br />
    Until the Ducklings all came out&mdash;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.</span><br />
    <br />
    One peeped out from beneath her wing,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">One scrambled on her back:</span><br />
    "That's very rude," said old Dame Duck,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Get off! quack, quack, quack, quack!"</span><br />
    <br />
    "'T is close," said Dame Duck, shoving out<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The egg-shells with her bill,</span><br />
    "Besides, it never suits young ducks<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To keep them sitting still."</span><br />
    <br />
    So, rising from her nest, she said,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Now, children, look at me:</span><br />
    A well-bred duck should waddle so,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">From side to side&mdash;d'ye see?"</span><br />
    <br />
    "Yes," said the little ones, and then<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">She went on to explain:</span><br />
    "A well-bred duck turns in its toes<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I do&mdash;try again."</span><br />
    <br />
    "Yes," said the Ducklings, waddling on.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That's better," said their mother;</span><br />
    "But well-bred ducks walk in a row,<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight&mdash;one behind another."</span><br />
    <br />
    "Yes," said the little Ducks again,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">All waddling in a row:</span><br />
    "Now to the pond," said old Dame Duck&mdash;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Splash, splash! and in they go.</span><br />
    <br />
    "Let me swim first," said old Dame Duck,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To this side, now to that;</span><br />
    There, snap at those great brown-winged flies,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They make young ducklings fat.</span><br />
    <br />
    "Now when you reach the poultry-yard,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hen-wife, Molly Head,</span><br />
    Will feed you, with the other fowls,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On bran and mashed-up bread;</span><br />
    <br />
    "The hens will peck and fight, but mind,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hope that all of you</span><br />
    Will gobble up the food as fast<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As well-bred ducks should do.</span><br />
    <br />
    "You'd better get into the dish,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unless it is too small;</span><br />
    In that case, I should use my foot,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And overturn it all."</span><br />
    <br />
    The Ducklings did as they were bid,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And found the plan so good,</span><br />
    That, from that day, the other fowls<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Got hardly any food.</span><br />

    <br />
    She has hopped from spray to spray,<br />

    Into all the folded leaves<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where caterpillars lie.</span><br />

    She has searched among the grass,<br />

    Catching gnats and flies, to feed<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her little family.</span><br />

    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For me to go through the town, heigho!"</span><br />
    <br />
    The Fox when he came to yonder stile,<br />
    He lifted his ears, and he listened awhile;<br />
    "Oh, ho!" said the Fox, "it's but a short mile<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">From this unto yonder town, heigho!"</span><br />
    <br />
    The Fox when he came to the farmer's gate,<br />
    Whom should he see but the farmer's Drake;<br />
    "I love you well for your master's sake,<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And long to be picking your bones, heigho!"</span><br />

    You'll do very well to ride on my back,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">From this into yonder town, heigho!"</span><br />

    <br />
    The farmer he loaded his pistol with lead,<br />
    And shot the old rogue of a Fox through the head;<br />

    There I met an old man, who would not say his prayers,<br />
    I took him by his left leg, and threw him down the stairs.<br />

    And have carried papa all the way on your back;<br />
    You shall have some nice oats, faithful Dobbin, indeed,<br />
    For you've brought papa home to his darling with speed.<br />
    <br />
    The howling wind blew, and the pelting rain beat,<br />
    And the thick mud has covered his legs and his feet,<br />
    But yet on he galloped in spite of the rain,<br />
    And has brought papa home to his darling again.<br />
    <br />
    The sun it was setting a long while ago,<br />
    And papa could not see the road where he should go,<br />
    But Dobbin kept on through the desolate wild,<br />
    And has brought papa home again safe to his child.<br />
    <br />
    Now go to the stable, the night is so raw,<br />

    <div class='title'>THE DIVERTING<br />
    HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN.</div>
    <div class='center'><br />
    <span class='small'>SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED,</span><br />
    <span class='small'>AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.</span></div>


    <div class="poem1"><br />
    <span class="smcap">John Gilpin</span> was a citizen<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of credit and renown,</span><br />
    A train-band captain eke was he,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of famous London town.</span><br />
    <br />
    John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Though wedded we have been</span><br />
    These twice ten tedious years, yet we<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">No holiday have seen.</span><br />
    <br />
    "To-morrow is our wedding-day,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we will then repair</span><br />
    Unto the "Bell" at Edmonton,<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">All in a chaise and pair.</span><br />
    <br />
    "My sister, and my sister's child,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Myself, and children three,</span><br />
    Will fill the chaise; so you must ride<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On horseback after we."</span><br />
    <br />
    He soon replied, "I do admire<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of womankind but one,</span><br />
    And you are she, my dearest dear,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore it shall be done.</span><br />
    <br />
    "I am a linendraper bold,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As all the world doth know,</span><br />
    And my good friend the calender<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will lend his horse to go."</span><br />
    <br />
    Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for that wine is dear,</span><br />
    We will be furnished with our own,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which is both bright and clear."</span><br />
    <br />
    John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'erjoyed was he to find,</span><br />
    That though on pleasure she was bent,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">She had a frugal mind.</span><br />

    </div>

    <div class="poem1">
    The morning came, the chaise was brought,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But yet was not allowed</span><br />
    To drive up to the door, lest all<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should say that she was proud.</span><br />
    <br />
    So three doors off the chaise was stayed,<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where they did all get in;</span><br />
    Six precious souls, and all agog<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dash through thick and thin.</span><br />
    <br />
    Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were never folks so glad!</span><br />
    The stones did rattle underneath,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if Cheapside were mad.</span><br />
    <br />
    John Gilpin at his horse's side<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seized fast the flowing mane,</span><br />
    And up he got, in haste to ride,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But soon came down again.</span><br />
    <br />
    For saddletree scarce reached had he,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His journey to begin,</span><br />
    When, turning round his head, he saw<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three customers come in.</span><br />
    <br />
    So down he came; for loss of time,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Although it grieved him sore,</span><br />
    Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would trouble him much more.</span><br />
    <br />
    'Twas long before the customers<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were suited to their mind,</span><br />
    When Betty screaming came downstairs,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The wine is left behind!"</span><br />
    <br />
    "Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">My leathern belt likewise,</span><br />
    In which I bear my trusty sword<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I do exercise."</span><br />
    <br />
    Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had two stone bottles found,</span><br />
    To hold the liquor that she loved,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And keep it safe and sound.</span><br />
    <br />
    Each bottle had a curling ear,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through which the belt he drew,</span><br />
    And hung a bottle on each side,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make his balance true.</span><br />
    <br />
    Then over all, that he might be<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Equipped from top to toe,</span><br />
    His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He manfully did throw.</span><br />
    <br />
    Now see him mounted once again<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon his nimble steed,</span><br />
    Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With caution and good heed.</span><br />
    <br />
    But finding soon a smoother road<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath his well-shod feet,</span><br />
    The snorting beast began to trot,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which galled him in his seat.</span><br />
    <br />
    "So, fair and softly!" John he cried,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But John he cried in vain;</span><br />
    That trot became a gallop soon,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In spite of curb and rein.</span><br />
    <br />
    So stooping down, as needs he must<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who cannot sit upright,</span><br />
    He grasped the mane with both his hands,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eke with all his might.</span><br />
    <br />
    His horse, who never in that sort<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had handled been before,</span><br />
    What thing upon his back had got,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did wonder more and more.</span><br />
    <br />
    Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away went hat and wig;</span><br />

    <div class="poem1">
    He little dreamt, when he set out,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of running such a rig.</span><br />
    <br />
    The wind did blow, the cloak did fly<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like streamer long and gay,</span><br />
    Till, loop and button failing both,<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last it flew away.</span><br />
    <br />
    Then might all people well discern<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bottles he had slung;</span><br />
    A bottle swinging at each side,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As hath been said or sung.</span><br />
    <br />
    The dogs did bark, the children screamed,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up flew the windows all;</span><br />
    And every soul cried out, "Well done!"<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As loud as he could bawl.</span><br />
    <br />
    Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he?<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His fame soon spread around:</span><br />
    "He carries weight! he rides a race!<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis for a thousand pound!"</span><br />
    <br />
    And still as fast as he drew near,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas wonderful to view</span><br />
    How in a trice the turnpike-men<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their gates wide open threw.</span><br />
    <br />
    And now, as he went bowing down<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His reeking head full low,</span><br />
    The bottles twain behind his back<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were shattered at a blow.</span><br />
    <br />
    Down ran the wine into the road,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most piteous to be seen,</span><br />
    Which made the horses flanks to smoke<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they had basted been.</span><br />
    <br />
    But still he seemed to carry weight,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With leathern girdle braced;</span><br />
    For all might see the bottle-necks<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still dangling at his waist.</span><br />
    <br />
    Thus all through merry Islington<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">These gambols he did play,</span><br />
    Until he came unto the Wash<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Edmonton so gay;</span><br />
    <br />
    And there he threw the wash about<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On both sides of the way,</span><br />
    Just like unto a trundling mop,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or a wild goose at play.</span><br />
    <br />
    At Edmonton his loving wife<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the balcony spied</span><br />
    Her tender husband, wondering much<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see how he did ride.</span><br />
    <br />
    "Stop, stop, John Gilpin!&mdash;Here's the house!"<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They all at once did cry;</span><br />
    "The dinner waits, and we are tired;"<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said Gilpin&mdash;"So am I!"</span><br />
    <br />
    But yet his horse was not a whit<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inclined to tarry there;</span><br />
    For why?&mdash;his owner had a house<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full ten miles off, at Ware.</span><br />
    <br />
    So like an arrow swift he flew,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shot by an archer strong;</span><br />
    So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The middle of my song.</span><br />
    <br />
    Away went Gilpin out of breath<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sore against his will,</span><br />
    Till at his friend the calender's,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His horse at last stood still.</span><br />
    <br />
    The calender, amazed to see<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His neighbour in such trim,</span><br />
    Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus accosted him:</span><br />

    "What news? what news? your tidings tell;<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell me you must and shall&mdash;</span><br />
    Say why bareheaded you are come,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or why you come at all?"</span><br />
    <br />
    Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And loved a timely joke;</span><br />
    And thus unto the calender<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In merry guise he spoke:</span><br />
    <br />
    "I came because your horse would come:<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, if I well forebode,</span><br />
    My hat and wig will soon be here,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They are upon the road."</span><br />
    <br />
    The calender, right glad to find<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His friend in merry pin,</span><br />
    Returned him not a single word,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to the house went in;</span><br />
    <br />
    Whence straight he came with hat and wig,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wig that flowed behind,</span><br />
    A hat not much the worse for wear,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each comely in its kind.</span><br />
    <br />
    He held them up, and in his turn<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus showed his ready wit,</span><br />
    "My head is twice as big as yours,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They therefore needs must fit.</span><br />
    <br />
    "But let me scrape the dirt away,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hangs upon your face;</span><br />

    And stop and eat, for well you may<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be in a hungry case."</span><br />
    <br />
    Said John, "It is my wedding-day,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the world would stare</span><br />
    If wife should dine at Edmonton,<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I should dine at Ware."</span><br />
    <br />
    So turning to his horse, he said,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I am in haste to dine;</span><br />
    'Twas for your pleasure you came here,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">You shall go back for mine."</span><br />
    <br />
    Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast!<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For which he paid full dear;</span><br />
    For while he spake, a braying ass<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did sing most loud and clear;</span><br />
    <br />
    Whereat his horse did snort, as he<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had heard a lion roar,</span><br />
    And galloped off with all his might,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he had done before.</span><br />
    <br />
    Away went Gilpin, and away<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went Gilpin's hat and wig:</span><br />
    He lost them sooner than at first,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For why&mdash;they were too big.</span><br />
    <br />
    Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her husband posting down</span><br />
    Into the country far away,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">She pulled out half-a-crown;</span><br />

    "Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!"<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not one of them was mute;</span><br />
