		T'was the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />
		Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br /> 
		The stockings were hung by the chimney with care<br /> 
		In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br /><br />

	p.5_1	
		The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />
		While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br />
		And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,<br />
		Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,<br />

	p.6_1
		When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />
		I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br />
		Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />
		Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br />

		The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br /> 
		Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,<br />
		When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />
		But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,<br />

	p.8_1
		With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br />
		I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick..<br />
		More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br />
		And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:<br />

		On, <b><i>Comet!</i></b> on, <b><i>Cupid!</i></b> on, <b><i>Donder</i></b> and <b><i>Blitzen!</i></b><br />
		To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br />
		Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br />

		As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br />
		When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br />
		So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br />
		With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too.<br />

		And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br />
		The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br />
		As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br />
		Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br />

	p.12_1
		He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br />
		And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br />
		A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,<br />
		And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br /><br /> </p>

	p.13_1
		His eyes&mdash;how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br />
		His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br />
		His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br />
		And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br />

	p.14_1
		The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br />
		And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br />
		He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br />
		That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.<br />

	p.15_1
		He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br />
		And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br />
		A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br />
		Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br /><br />

	p.16_1
		He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br />
		And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br /> 
		And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br />
		And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br />

	p.17_1
		He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br />
		And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br />
		But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br />
		<b><i>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night."</i></b><br>
